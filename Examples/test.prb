* Thevenin/Norton Equivalent
** David Johns
-------
Thevenin's theorem is used to replace a multiple element circuit with a single voltage source and resistor while Norton's theorem is used to replace a 

$$E=MC^2\label{1}\tag{1}$$

Above is an equation and I can refer to it as equation (\ref{1}) and it should work 

1) item 1
2) item 2
3) item 3

* This is a main heading
** and this is a sub heading
*** while this is a sub-sub heading
and here is an inline equation $E=MC^2$ that should work
