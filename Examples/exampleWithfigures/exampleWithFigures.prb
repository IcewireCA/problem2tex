Below is the symbols for NMOS and PMOS transistors (recall the bulk is connected to the source so the bulk terminal is not shown)

A plot of $I_D$ vs $V_{DS}$ for various $V_{GS}$ values is shown below when the transistor is in triode and active regions.

For this example: $V_{tn}=0.3V$; $\mu_nC_{ox} = 240 \mu A/V^2$; $W/L=100$; $\lambda_n = 0.1 mA/V$
