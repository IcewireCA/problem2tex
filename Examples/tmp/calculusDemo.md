# Solution


(a\) Let $Q = Q_0a^t$.
Substituting $t = 18$, $Q = 89.4$ and $t = 22$, $Q = 94.7$ gives two equations for $Q_0$ and $a$:

$${89.4}=Q_0a^{18}  \text{ and } {94.7}=Q_0a^{22} $$  
Dividing the two equations enables us to eliminate $Q_0$:

$$\frac{{94.7}}{{89.4}}=\frac{Q_0a^{22}}{Q_0a^{18}}=a^{4} $$
Solving for the base, $a$, gives

$$\bbox[yellow]{a=\left(\frac{{94.7}}{{89.4}}\right)^{(1/{4})}={1.015} }$$

(b\) Since $a=1.015$, the growth rate is $1.015 - 1 = 0.015 = \bbox[yellow]{1.45\%}$

(c\) We want to evaluate $f(22) = Q_0a^{22} = Q_0(1.015)^{22}$. First we need to find $Q_0$ from the equation
$${89.4}=Q_0({1.015})^{18} $$
Solving gives

$$Q_0 = \frac{{89.4}}{({1.015})^{18}}={68.989} $$
Thus,

$$\bbox[yellow]{f(22)=Q_0a^{22} = 94.7}$$
