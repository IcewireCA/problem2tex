Consider the circuit shown below where it is desired to find the Norton and Thevenin equivalent circuits between nodes A/B. Use \(i_{sc}\) for the short circuit output current and \(v_{oc}\) for the open circuit output voltage and \(R_{out}\) for the output resistance.

Solve by using Thevenin/Norton source transformations.
