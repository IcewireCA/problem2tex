\subsection*{David Johns}
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{1pt}
Thevenin's theorem is used to replace a multiple element circuit with a single voltage source and resistor while Norton's theorem is used to replace a

\[E=MC^2\label{1}\tag{1}\]

Above is an equation and I can refer to it as equation (\ref{1}) and it should work

1) item 1
2) item 2
3) item 3
